"""
Reusable, ROS-free LiDAR processing helpers.

Every reactive planner in this workspace ends up doing the same handful of
operations on a ``sensor_msgs/LaserScan``: throw away ranges outside the
forward field of view, smooth out noise, clamp impossible distances, and
convert a beam index back into a steering angle.

These functions take and return plain NumPy arrays / scalars so they can be
unit-tested without spinning up a ROS node. The angle math is driven by the
scan's *real* ``angle_min`` / ``angle_increment`` rather than assuming a full
360 deg sweep, so it is correct for any LiDAR (the Hokuyo on this car only
covers ~270 deg).
